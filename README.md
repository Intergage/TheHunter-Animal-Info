# TheHunter-Animal-Info
Powershell script to quickly lookup basic info on certain animals from TheHunter-Classic game. 

## Install - Temp (Pretty dirty)
1. Download and extrat the zip into a folder. Any folder, doesn't matter. Just remember what it is.
2. Open up Powershell (Haven't tested on anything other then v5, if you have win10 you have v5 so all G)
    * TRY: Hold the Shift key and right click inside the folder were the .ps1 and .json files are. 
         If you have the option "Open PowerShell window here", Use this. If not, follow next step.
3. If you didn't have that option you'll need to navigate to the folder you saved the script in.
    * EG: cd C:\users\USERNAME\Desktop\AnimalInfo
4. Once in the right location type *Animal_Info.ps1* and press enter.

#### This is the very basic quick version. I have a lot to add (See below) and also make it easier to install and use.

  * Easier Install
  * Maps open in GUI element
  * Neater Info Cards
  * Maybe a Menu...
